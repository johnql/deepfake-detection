# Deepfake Detection Optimized Solution

Abstract
In the last few years, we have seen a surge of manipulated digital images and videos, generated by sophisticated AI and machine learning models and tools. Those convincing-looking forgery could lead to significant social impacts. There is an ever-increased need to develop automatic deepfake detection techniques to fight against this kind of forgery. 
Many automatic forgery detection techniques have been developed. In this report, a complete and optimized forgery detection package is proposed and tested with the popular Kaggle’s deepfake challenge dataset. In the preprocessing transformation stage, the facenet Mtcnn face detection system is implemented, as it outperforms all the other existing face detection systems in our experiments. In the next stage, the latest state-of-the-art EfficientNet-B7 network model is adapted to extract the feature embedding.  Those embedding are further processed by a “PCA + t-SNE '' dimension reduction technique in combination with HDBSCAN clustering method. Finally, EfficientNet-B7 + Softmax CNN classifier network is trained to provide very competitive deepfake prediction results.
